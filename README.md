This python-based machine learning project showcases a remarkable achievement in Indian Sign Language communication â€“ a real-time Alphanumeric Gesture Recognition System. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model training, our system can swiftly and accurately detect and interpret complex alphanumeric gestures from the Indian Sign Language lexicon. This technological breakthrough holds immense potential to enhance communication and inclusivity for the hearing-impaired community, fostering greater understanding and collaboration between deaf and hearing individuals.
